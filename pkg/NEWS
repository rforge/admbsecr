admbsecr 0.1.4
--------------

* Added further methods to contours() function. It now works with
  the "dist" and "mrds" methods.

* When contours() is used on a fit of method "ang", arrows are plotted
  from the traps, indicating the estimated bearing of the animal.

* The labels on contour plots now correspond to the estimated
  probability of the individual being located within the contour,
  rather than probability density.

* The user can specify the (approximate) probability values at which
  contours will be drawn.

* A new argument ('detfn') has been added to admbsecr(), allowing the
  user to choose a detection function. Options are "hn" (halfnormal),
  "hr" (hazard rate), "th" (threshold), and "logth" (log-link
  threshold).

* The signal strength method now allows a log link function for
  expected received signal strength. This is done from a call to
  admbsecr using the arguments 'method = "ss", detfn = "log"'.

admbsecr 0.1.3
--------------

* Added functions mrdstrapcov() and disttrapcov(), which fit SECR
  models in the specific case where:

    * There are only two traps, both at the same location.

    * Additional information is the estimated or exact distance
      the animal.

    * Each trap is associated with its own halfnormal detection
      function.

  Eventually these specific cases will also be handled by admbsecr().

* Added further methods to contours() function. It now works with
  methods "sstoa", "ang", and "disttc".

* Further cosmetic improvements to contours().

* The admbsecr() function now accepts an argument which fixes
  parameters at a specific value.

admbsecr 0.1.2
--------------

* Added additional method:

    * "mrds" -- SECR with known animal locations. Equivalent to
      mark-recapture distance sampling.

* Added contours() function, which plots estimated animal location
  densities. This currently works with fits from methods "simple",
  "toa", and "ss".

* Major bug fix: Methods "ang" and "dist" did not work, as a file
  (bessel.cxx) needs to be available.

* Minor bug fixes regarding error and warning messages.

* Capture history matrices with more than one session now result in an
  error message.

* A log link function is no longer used to calculated expected
  received signal strength for methods "ss" and "sstoa". Eventually
  both options will be available to the user.

admbsecr 0.1.1
--------------

* Added additional method:

    * "dist" -- SECR with estimated distance information.

* Added the parameter `bounds` to admbsecr(). This allows the user to
  specify bounds on any parameters they wish to, overriding the
  defaults.

* A log link function is now used to calculate expected received
  signal strength for methods "ss" and "sstoa".

* Bug fix to `profpars` parameter of admbsecr(). Profile likelihood
  now works.

* Bug fix to issue with specifying start values in a named vector out
  of order.

admbsecr 0.1.0
--------------

* Initial release of admbsecr.

* Implemented methods are:

    * "simple" -- SECR with no additional information.

    * "toa" -- SECR with time-of-arrival information.

    * "ang" -- SECR with angle information.

    * "ss" -- SECR with signal strength information.

    * "sstoa" -- SECR with both signal strength and time-of-arrival
      information.
