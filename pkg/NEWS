--------------

* Added additional method:

    * "dist" -- SECR with estimated distance information.

* Added the parameter `bounds` to admbsecr(). This allows the user to
  specify bounds on any parameters they wish to, overriding the
  defaults.

* A log link function is now used to calculate expected received
  signal strength for methods "ss" and "sstoa".

* Bug fix to `profpars` parameter of admbsecr(). Profile likelihood
  now works.

  of order.
